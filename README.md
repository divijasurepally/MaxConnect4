# MaxConnect4
Innovative Game Development: Developed an interactive MaxConnect4 game, transforming the traditional Connect Four concept into a competitive AI-driven challenge. The project's focal point was to create an engaging platform where players compete against a sophisticated AI opponent, enhancing the classic gameplay experience with advanced strategic elements.

Advanced AI Implementation: Employed the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to power the AI's decision-making process, ensuring efficient and intelligent gameplay. This approach allowed the AI to anticipate future moves and counter the human player's strategies, making each game unique and intellectually stimulating.

Algorithmic Optimization and Game Mechanics: Optimized game performance through effective use of Python's data structures and control flows, ensuring seamless game progressions and real-time score tracking. The project involved managing complex game states, including board configurations, player turns, and scoring systems, to accurately reflect the dynamic nature of the game.
